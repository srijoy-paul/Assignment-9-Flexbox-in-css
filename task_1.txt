Differences between Flexbox layout model and Grid layout model in CSS :

Choosing Between Flexbox and Grid one over the other:

Use Flexbox When:
1. Dealing with one-dimensional layouts (either rows or columns).
2. When the order of elements in the code is different from their visual order.
3. Aligning or distributing items along one direction.
4. Working with simpler structures like navigation bars or lists.

Use Grid When:
1. Dealing with two-dimensional layouts (both rows and columns).
2. Requiring precise control over the placement of items.When we want exact control over where each item goes.
3. Creating complex layouts with different sections.For intricate designs with different sections or areas.
4. Emphasizing responsive design with automatic adaptation to different screen sizes.

Note: Often, using both Flexbox and Grid together is a great approach. Flexbox can handle the inside layout of items within a Grid, combining their strengths. The choice depends on what your project's layout needs are.
